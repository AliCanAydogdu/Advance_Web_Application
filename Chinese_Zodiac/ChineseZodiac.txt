The Chinese New Year does not fall on the same date each year, although it is always in January or February.

The Chinese New Year is an important celebration all over the world. There are similar celebrations in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival.

In the past the current emperor determined the start of the New Year. Today celebrations are based on Emperor Han Wu Di's almanac. It uses the first day of the first month of the Lunar Year as the start of Chinese New Year. 

Celebrations today are both literal and symbolic. Spring cleaning is started about a month prior to the new year and must be completed before the celebrations begin.

Typically red packets with money tucked inside are given out as a symbol of good luck. The amount is usually an even number as odd numbers are regarded as unlucky. 

Lions are considered to be good omens. The lion dance is believed to repel demons. Each lion has two dancers, one to maneuver the head, the other the back.

During the New Year celebrations people do not fight or be mean to each other, as this would bring a bad, unlucky year.

Everyone celebrates their birthday on this day as well and turns one year older.
